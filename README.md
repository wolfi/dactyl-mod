# dactyl-mod

A modified version of the Dactyl keyboard based on https://ryanis.cool/cosmos/. I've customized several aspects to suit my preferences.

Everything is modeled in Blender, because I have zero skills in any CAD software. Also I have only slightly more then zero skills in Blender, so don't put too much trust into what you find here.

## TBD

* Trackball version
* Plum Twist PCB version
